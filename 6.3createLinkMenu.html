        <h1>Really Honest Book Reviews</h1>
        <p>
            I read a lot of books about many different subjects. Though I'm not a 
            book critic, and I don't do this for a living, I enjoy a really good    
            read every now and then. Here's a list of books that I've read recently:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="rainbow.html"><em>The Rainbow Returns</em> by E. Smith</a>
                A fantasy story set in biblical times. Slow at times, but interesting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="programmer.html"><em>How to be a Great Programmer</em> by J. Hacker</a>
                A must-read for anyone who wants to be a programmer. It's a bit dry, but very informative.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="internet.html"><em>Mastering the Internet</em> by A. Webhead</a>
                A great book for anyone who wants to learn about the Internet. It's a bit outdated,
                 but still useful.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="silly.html"><em>The Silly Person's Guide to Seriousness</em> by M. Nott</a>
                A funny book that makes you think. It's a bit silly, but very entertaining.
